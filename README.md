Scripts that I have found to be useful enough to be worth sharing somewhere. 

## pdf_to_txt.R
Reads the text in every pdf in the same directory as the script, then outputs them all to a separate text file. Useful for indexing and searching in a directory with many unconsolidated files. Has your assistant been saving your meeting minutes in pdf files for years and you need to look up something that was said at some point but you can't remember exactly what? This script is perfect. You can convert the whole directory to text, search it, find exactly which file you need. 

## pdfcombiner.py
Don't you hate when your real estate agent sends you a bunch of loose pdf documents to sign, and you have to get your own docusigner, sign them, combine them, then send them back. But every online pdf combiner is a sketchy website that wants a subscription payment and is probably going to steal your real estate contract and sell it? Well, no more. Simply drop this script into a folder with all of your pdf documents and run it. You can select whether you want them combined in alphabetical order or in order of last edit.
